            Even if disco began very much like an underground phenomenon, the genre emerged into the mainstream scene during the mid-1970s. Disco stars like the Bee Gees, Abba, and Gloria Gaynor, experienced massive success throughout the ‘70s, this also brought disco music out of the clubs and onto the charts and pop radio at the same time disco clubs became a popular entertaining area for millions of people outside of the original underground scene.

            Probably the most famous, and notorious discotheque in the 1970s would be Studio 54 in New York City. Even celebrities from all over the world went to Studio 54  just to party and dance to the latest disco records, do illegal drugs, and enjoy the peak of American decadence. Clubs such as Studio 54 also symbolized both the over-the-top glitz and glamour of 1970s disco and the excesses, superficiality, and hedonism of the era.

            On the other hand, disco never experienced the abrupt loss of popularity in Europe but rather it morphed into other genres, like synth-pop, Italo disco, and eventually house and techno.
