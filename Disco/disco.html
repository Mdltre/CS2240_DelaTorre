            Disco is one of those complicated terms that means different things to different people. Most of us probably associate disco with the movie Saturday Night Fever and a 
            phase of popular music and fashion that was isolated in the 1970s, but this perception does not fully define disco itself. In fact, disco music is a part of the ongoing 
            story of electronic dance music, one that evolved into something else rather than ending and being just a phase in the early 1980s.
